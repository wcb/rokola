See screenshot.png for a hopefully self-explanatory demo.

1. Get all the dependencies
2. Run MPD, configure it to point to your music directory
3. Create a playlist (to play when there are no songs queued)
2. Run ruby rokola.rb
3. Invite all your friends to a geek-oriented party (bring laptops)
4. Give them the URL: http://your-ip:4567
5. Click on songs to queue them!

Inspired by the modren Jukebox at Chez Lucien, and by Giles Bowkett.
Use of a Token Bucket inspired by the guy who queued up a dozen Elvis songs. ;)

LOGIC BEHIND THE QUEUE
...wip.

TODO
 - Update with AJAX
 - Test all possible cases in a real environment
   . What happens when the playlist ends?
   . What happens when the playlist loops?
   . Should we support tampering by a user directly connected to MPD?
